\-----------------------------------------------
I first encountered data analytics in 2021 when I started my career at the university as a research assistant. In this role, I worked on analyzing large volumes of data, applying my knowledge of statistics to write scientific papers. Since August 2024, I have been studying Python to speed up the processes of data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Since September 2024, I have been taking a 7-month course at Yandex Practicum on "Data Analytics," where I deepened my knowledge of SQL and learned to write queries of varying complexity. As part of the course, I also explored Python's capabilities using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, and became familiar with the Yandex DataLens data visualization and analysis system. In this repository, I have placed the projects I have worked on and my scientific publications.
